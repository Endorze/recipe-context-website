if not logged in = create account/login page

if logged in = main page

if not logged in they are locked out of content, aka they should not be able to reach the main-page unless logged in.

Favorite category should be shown if account has one.
Favorizing a category overrides the second one? or should i have several favorites?

If we create a fake customer, set their favorite food to be "beef" then show beef related foods.
maybe a "Welcome back "username" feeling hungry?"
"Your favorite food is blabla"
"you have x saved recipes"
if no saved recipes or no favorite foods, display different UI.

Should be able to display a list of categories.

Dynamic Routing for everything
Use context.

fetch meal by idnumber
each meal has the same link, however the id's are different.
So maybe terikayi chicken is id 1, pancakes id 2 etc.



Layout ------------------------------

Login page if not logged in

Homepage once logged in (or Homepage if i save logged in state in localstorage which i most likely wont)

Profile page (Maybe display a profile pic if wanna make it personal)
Age, location, blabla info that ill think off when i get there.

Recipes page where it displays all recipes as "cards", pressing one opens a subpage with the ID, displays recipe info, how to cook, maybe a favorite button once on the subpage and on the card?

Page with favourited recipes.

-------------------------------------

Done for now, will most likely be edited.
